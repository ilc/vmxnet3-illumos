vmxnet3 driver for Illumos

History:

This driver was nearly committed to the Illumos tree.  It seems to have
stumbled at the last second and resurrecting it involved finding a
webrev that was not the final one, though the code looks to have been in
nearly final condition if not final.

The patchset this work is based on was produced by, Michael Tsymbalyuk.

The initial code was written by VMWare.

Installation:

Make sure your compiler is on your path.

make 
make install

Enjoy your new driver.

Hints and tips:

VMWare Fusion's internal network seems to have a 1500 MTU between VMs, this
can cause some real confusion when debugging issues, please set the mtu
correctly for your application.

Notes:

This project will disappear if Illumos accepts the patches, or VMWare
releases a stable driver based on this work.
